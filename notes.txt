1. For each problem, provide in no more than 100 words, a short, high-level description of the problem;
your approach to solve it; and any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve them.

Problem 1 (Reverse):
	in reverse function using for loop and temp variable the first and last value are exchanged until it reaches the half of the length of an array

Problem 2 (Euclidean Distance):
	here distance function was created in which the the sqrt of the equation is the returned to the main function which prints distance as standard output

Problem 3 (Transpose):
	here in transpose function the rows were given as column and column as rows in new array
	then the value were taken from the main array into the new array which is then returned.

Problem 4 (Palindrome):
	in palindrome function using for loop the first and last variable are compared to see if they are same and it runs until the half of the length of given string and if is same then is printed true or ese false as standard output

Problem 5 (Sine Function):
	in sin function we used the while loop to find the value of sin of the equation x - ((x^3)/3!) + ((x^5)/5!) - ((x^7)/7!) +...
	then the total is returned which is then printed as standard output

Problem 6 (RSA Library):
	three function keygen, encrypt and decrypt was created in which in encrypt and decrypt the value of equation was returned while in keygen
	the prime function was created in which prime numbers were found and then using it n, e and d was returned

Problem 7 (Keygen Program): 
	two values were taken from command line argument and using rsa keygen function values of n, e and d were then printed as standard output. 

Problem 8 (Encryption Program): 
	Two values were assigned from command line argument and then using rsa bitlength fuction the width was decided.
	then message was taken from standard input and then using for loop and rsa encrypt and dec2bin function the message was encrypted using every character of message.

Problem 9 (Decryption Program):
	Two values were assigned from command line argument and then using rsa bitlength fuction the width was decided.
	then message was taken from standard input and then using for loop and rsa bin2dec and decrypt function the message was decrypted using every character of message.
