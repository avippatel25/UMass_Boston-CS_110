1. For each problem, provide in no more than 100 words, a short, high-level description of the problem;
your approach to solve it; and any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve them.

Problem 1 (Sum of Integers):
    in this program recursion is used where the sum of n integers is calculated where a function is called with the previous nuber of integer
    and the integer is added with it.

Problem 2 (Bit Counts):
    here in this program the string where the binary number is passed
    and then using two different function the value of each element is checked whether its 0 or  and then
    the number of ones and no of zeros and total elements of string is returned

Problem 3 (String Reversal):
    in this program a string is passed and using recursion a function
    is called where the string of length removing last element is passed and then the last element is returned in that function

Problem 4 (Palindrome):
    in this program the the string is passed where then the function is called and the string's first and last element is checked
    if its same then same function is called passing a new string without
    first and last element and once all condition satisfies then true is returned or else false

Problem 5 (Password Checker):
    there were 5 condition so usinf a function and if anf for loop the 5 condition are checked
    and once all are true than true is returned or else even if one condition is false then false is returned
    and then true or false is printed as standard output

Problem 6 (Point Data Type):
    here in this function two points x and y are initialized
    and using euclidean distance formula the distance between two instance points is returned
    and is printed

Problem 7 (Interval Data Type):
    here in this function two points are initialized as lower bound and upper bound
    and using them two things are checked if a point is in that interval and if a point is intersecting that interval line
    and true or false is returned

Problem 8 (Rectangle Data Type):
    here using the upper program the width and height of rectangle is taken
    and using contains and intersects function these conditions are checked if another rectangle is intersecting that rectangle
    and if they satisfy these condition than true or false is printed

Problem 9 (Particle Representation):
    in these program using given information the blob is created where we use intialization of variables and using mass we identify
    the particle as blob or not and we measure the distance between two blob and then
    return as standard output using euclidean distance formula

Problem 10 (Particle Identification):
    here in this program using previous program the particle is indentified whether its blob or not using condition
    if the mass of blob is greater than pixel and if passed threshold given
    using for loop we travel across each pixel in x and y axis and identify the blob

Problem 11 (Particle Tracking):
    using previous program after identifying the particle we check its nearby
    pixels to see where the particle is travelling and then we find the nearest distance of the previous particle position with its current positions
    and then we return the distance ad print them

Problem 12 (Estimating Avogadro's Constant):
    using given formulas to get the displacement and then var and then k we calculate avogadros constant
    and then we print them as standard output and we do used the given values of global variable like ETA, RHO, T and R.
