1. For each problem, provide in more than 100 words, a short, high-level description of the problem;
your approach to solve it; and any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve them.

Problem 1 (Reverse):
	a variable was created to accept standard input.
	then n is given length of a variable and for loop was used so interchange the first and last variable until the half of the length of n.
	then for loop is used with if condition to print the word backward with space in between alphabets.

Problem 2 (Euclidean Distance):
	a variable n is given command line value as argument.
	then x and y lists are created and using for loop the standard input value is inserted in those lists.
	new variable distance is given 0.0 value and using for loop the square of difference of two elements from list is added to distance.
	square root of distance is then printed as standard output.

Problem 3 (Birthday Problem):
	first 365 value is given to days_per_year and trials is given value as command line argument, count is assigned 0 value.
	for loop is used to create an array birthdays and infinte loop is used to increase count by 1 and insert random date to birthday variable.
	if the value of birthday in array is found then the loop is breaked and the value of count/trial is printed else true value is given to birthday in birthdays.

Problem 4 (Transpose):
	m and n variables are assigned value as command line arguments.
	2d array a is created of size mXn and value is given as none.
	for loop is used to insert value to matrix using standard input.
	2d array c is created of size nXm and value is given none.
	for loop is used to insert the value of a matrix to c matrix in transpose way.
	c matrix is than printed as transpose of a matrix.

Problem 5 (Pascal's Triangle):
	n variable is assigned value as command line argument.
	a 1d matrix of n+1 size is created.
	for loop is used to insert an aray of a[element] so an 2d array is formed.
	for loop is used to change the value of a 2d array.
	for loop is used to print the 2 dimensional array.

Problem 6 (Generating the Waltz):
	one minuetmeasures and one triomeasures array are created of 2d array with length 11X16 and 6X16 respectively.
	for loops are used to insert the values associated with the matrice given in question.
	again for loops are used to print the random 16 minuet and 16 trio numbers.

Problem 7 (Playing the Waltz):
	one measures variable was created to accept all the int value from generatewaltz file by using for loop  to use correct cord from two data/M and data/T files and then the file is played.
	also messages are printed if the length of measure is not 32, less than 1 and greter than 176 for minuet and less than 1 and greater than 96.
