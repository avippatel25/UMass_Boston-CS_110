1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical jargon) of each problem
in no more than 100 words.

Problem 1 (Quadratic Equation):
    Three variable a,b and c are assigned value from command line.
    if the variable of x^2 is 0 than a message is printed. If discriminant is 0 than a message is printed.
    once both the roots are founded using formula and math library, both the roots are printed as standard output.

Problem 2 (Wind Chill):
    Two variables t and v are assigned value from command line.
    if the value of t exceeds 50 than a message is printed. If the value of v is less than or equal to 3 than a message is printed.
    Using formula the value is stored in variable w and it is printed as standard output.

Problem 3 (Day of the Week):
    Three variables m,d and y are assigned value as command line.
    using formula value is stored in dow variable.
    using given information the value of dow is assigned a day and that is printed as standard output.

Problem 4 (Six-sided Die):
    using stdrandom library any number is picked between 1 to 6.
    using pattern the number is printed as shown on the top of the dice.

Problem 5 (Playing Card):
    using stdrandom library club and card number is picked.
    every number of value of club is assigned to the name of club.
    which ever club is selected the name of the card with its number is printed as stadard output.

Problem 6 (Dragon Curve):
    Variable n is assigned value from command line.
    F value is given to two variables.
    for loop is used to store the value of the dragon curve which is formed using the idea provided in question.
    the value of dragon is than printed as standard output.

Problem 7 (Greatest Common Divisor):
    Two variable p and q are assigned value from command line.
    using mac function maximum number is stored in mx and 1 is assigned to gcd variable.
    for loop is used to find the number which divides both the number and is than stored in gcd.
    the value of gcd is than printed as standard output.

Problem 8 (Root Finding):
    three variables k,c and epsilon are assigned value from command line.
    value of c is given to t and while loop is used until the k_th root is greater than epsilon.
    th new value is given to t upto epsilon decimal place.
    value of t is printed as standard output.

Problem 9 (Sum of Powers):
    Two variable n and k is assigned value from command line.
    0 is given to the sum variable.
    for loop is used from  range 1 to n and the sum of powers is assigned to sum.
    sum is than printed as standard output.

Problem 10 (Factorial Function):
    variable n is assigned value from command line.
    if n is 0 than 1 is printed as the 0!=1.
    using for loop from range 1 to n the value of i than mutiplied with the previous value stored in fact and is than stored in fact.
    value of fact is than printed as standard output.

Problem 11 (Fibonacci Function):
    Variable n is assigned value from command line.
    a,b and i are given values,
    while loop is used until i is less than or equal to n and the variable c has given the value of sum of a and b and than a is exchanged with b and b with c.
    value of b is than printed as standard output.

Problem 12 (Primality Test):
    Variable n is assigned value from command line.
    i is given 2 as value.
    while loop is used until i divides n and once the number is found than its compared if its prime.
    If its prime than True or else False is printed as standard output.

Problem 13 (Counting Primes):
    Variable n is assigned value from command line.
    count is given 0 value.
    for loop is used from range 2 to n and j is given value 2.
    while loop is than used until value of j is same as value of i divided by j.
    if j divides i than loop is breaked and once the prime number is found than the value of count is increased by one.
    finally value of count is printed as standard output.

Problem 14 (Perfect Numbers):
    Variable n is assigned value from command line.
    for loop is used from range 2 to n and total is assigned 0 value.
    for loop is used from range 1 to the half of i and if the number divides i than the sum of total and j is given to total.
    and once the value of total is same as i than its printed as standard output.

Problem 15 (Ramanujan Numbers):
    Variable n is assigned value from command line.
    a is given 1 as value.
    while loops are used for every variable until the cube of the variable is equal to n.
    once the numbers is found who has the sum of the cube of two number than its check with the other number.
    if both of them matched than the value and sum of the cubes of number is printed as described in question as standard output.
